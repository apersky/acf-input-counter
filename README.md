# ACF Input Counter

> Supports ACF 5 and above.

***This plugin is a fork of https://github.com/Hube2/acf-input-counter. It has been specifically modified for the use of 5 Fold Marketing.***

Adds a counter to all text and textarea fields with character limits.

This is a simple plugin that will add a counter below all ACF text and text area fields to show how many
characters have been added and what the limit is. The display will look something like this:

`Chars: 25/55`

This plugin also serves as a simple example of how to extend the functionality of fields in ACF 5.
